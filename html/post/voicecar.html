        <h2>Voice Command Controlled Car</h2>
        <br>
        <article>
          <p>
            This project involved designing and implementing a voice-controlled robotic car capable of precise navigation using machine learning for voice classification and feedback control systems for trajectory correction. A strong emphasis was placed on data preprocessing, dimensionality reduction, and real-time classification accuracy to enable reliable and responsive control.
          </p>
          
          <h3>Key Features</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>Accurate voice classification using SVD and PCA for dimensionality reduction.</li>
            <li>Implemented centroid-based clustering for robust command recognition.</li>
            <li>Enhanced trajectory precision with closed-loop control for real-time path correction.</li>
            <li>Integrated hardware and software systems for a seamless user experience.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Data Collection & Preprocessing</h3>
          <p>
            Voice data was collected using a microphone setup, sampling commands under varied conditions. Preprocessing steps included:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Enveloping:</strong> Detected the amplitude envelope of audio signals to isolate key features of the voice commands.</li>
            <li><strong>Normalization:</strong> Scaled audio signals to a uniform range to ensure consistency across samples.</li>
            <li><strong>Demeaning:</strong> Subtracted the mean from each feature dimension, centering the data around the origin for PCA.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Dimensionality Reduction with SVD and PCA</h3>
          <p>
            To reduce the high dimensionality of the audio data:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):</strong> Decomposed the data matrix into orthogonal components to extract key features efficiently.</li>
            <li><strong>Principal Component Analysis (PCA):</strong> Identified the top three principal components that captured the most variance, significantly reducing computational complexity while retaining essential information.</li>
            <li>The reduced dataset was projected into the PCA basis, enabling effective visualization and clustering.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Clustering and Classification</h3>
          <p>
            Centroid-based clustering was employed to classify the commands:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>For each command, centroids were computed by averaging feature vectors in the reduced PCA space.</li>
            <li>Test samples were classified by calculating the Euclidean distance to each centroid, assigning the closest one.</li>
            <li>Achieved 100% accuracy on test samples, demonstrating the reliability of the clustering method.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Model Enhancement</h3>
          <p>
            To further improve classification accuracy:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li>Outliers were removed from the training dataset to reduce noise in the clustering process.</li>
            <li>Experimented with different numbers of principal components to balance accuracy and computational efficiency.</li>
            <li>Introduced an additional noise filtering step to handle environmental disturbances during real-time classification.</li>
          </ul>

          <h3>Car Control Integration</h3>
          <p>
            The classified commands controlled the car as follows:
          </p>
          <ul>
            <li><strong>"Congrats":</strong> Drive straight (long).</li>
            <li><strong>"Stop":</strong> Drive straight (short).</li>
            <li><strong>"Unicorn":</strong> Turn left.</li>
            <li><strong>"Roni":</strong> Turn right.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>
            The closed-loop control system used encoder feedback to correct deviations from the intended trajectory, ensuring precise execution of commands.
          </p>

          <h3>Challenges and Solutions</h3>
          <ul>
            <li>
              <strong>Challenge:</strong> Handling variability in voice samples.<br>
              <strong>Solution:</strong> Applied normalization and SVD to extract consistent features across samples.

              <strong>Solution:</strong> Implemented a feedback-based closed-loop system with error correction.
            </li>
          </ul>
